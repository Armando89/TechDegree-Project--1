        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I was born in Mexico City in April of 1989. At the age of 10 my family and I moved to the US. I discovered coding about 9 years ago and I immediately felt in love with the idea of having the power to create incredible things on the web.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am a steel worker who works for a very large company as an overhead crane operator. Even though, I am very thankful and lucky to work for my current employer I do not picture myself working there long-term since my dream is to become a web developer in the future.</p>
        <p>I love sports in general from basketball, baseball, volleyball, tennis, but my true passion is football, soccer for some people, I just can't get enough of it either playing or watching it. But also, I am a big time gamer.</p>
