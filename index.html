        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Let me start by saying that I was born in Mexico City and at the age of 10 my family and I moved to the US. I discovered coding about 9 years ago and I immediately felt in love with the idea of having the power to create fabulous things on the web.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am a steel worker who works for a very large company as an overhead crane operator. Even though, I am very thankful and lucky to work at this company I do not see myself working there for the rest of my life since my dream is to become a web developer one day.</p>
        <p>I love sports in general from basketball, baseball, volleyball, tennis, but my true passion since I can remember is football, soccer in the US, I just can't get enough of it either playing it or watching it. But also, I am a big time gamer.</p>
