        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I was born in Mexico City in April of 1989. At the age of 10 my family and I moved to the US. I discovered coding about 9 years ago and I immediately felt in love with the idea of having the power to create incredible things on the web.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am a steel worker who works for a very large company as an overhead crane operator. Even though, I am very thankful and lucky to work for my current employer I do not picture myself working there long-term since my dream is to become a web developer in the future.</p>
